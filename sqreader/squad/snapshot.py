"""
Produce one snapshot of the current Squad game state, as a JSON-friendly
Python dict that follows (a subset of) the kickoff schema.

Phase 3 scope (first cut):
- one entry per live SQPlayerState (skipping the CDO):
    playerId, name, team, role, eosId, score, ping, isBot,
    soldier: { classShort, health, breathHoldStamina }
- counts of singletons (SQGameState/Mode/Instance) and class histograms
  for diagnostic purposes
- timestamp + server identifier

Position, vehicles, game/map state, kills/deaths come in subsequent
iterations (Phase 3d/3e and beyond).

Design notes:
- We walk GUObjectArray ONCE per snapshot, classifying each UObject by
  its class name. This is ~0.5 s for 227k UObjects on this hardware.
  At 3 Hz that's 1.5 s of CPU per second — too high for production but
  fine for the one-shot mode. The continuous mode will cache class
  pointers and filter by class on subsequent passes.
- All field reads use no-guess policy: failed reads become null in the
  output, never fabricated.

# Remote offset overrides (Phase 1: rebuild-less self-heal)

# When a Squad patch drifts a hardcoded offset, central serves a signed offset
# pack and the agent applies it AT RUNTIME instead of shipping new code. A pack
# is {key: int} where key is either a scalar constant NAME (e.g.
# "SQ_VEHICLE_TURRETS_OFFSET") or "DICT.KEY" (e.g. "DEPLOYABLE_OFFSETS.Team").
#
# The overridable set is derived by NAMING CONVENTION over this module's globals
# (…_OFFSET/_OFF/_SIZE ints and …_OFFSETS int-dicts), evaluated at call time —
# so every offset constant defined anywhere in this module is covered, new ones
# are covered automatically, and a pack can NEVER touch a non-offset attribute
# (functions, classes, resolved addresses). Only EXISTING dict keys can be
# patched (a pack cannot invent fields); unknown/malformed keys are ignored
# (forward-compat). Baked-in originals are captured once so a pack applies
# reversibly — a doctor-failed apply rolls back exactly.
